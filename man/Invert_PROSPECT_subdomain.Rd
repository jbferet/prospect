\arguments{
\item{New_Features}{spectral bands (in nm) to be added to the Initial_Features}

\item{Refl}{numeric. matrix of reflectances (n spectral bands x p samples)}

\item{Tran}{numeric. matrix of transmittances (n spectral bands x p samples)}

\item{SpecPROSPECT}{list. Optical constants for a spectral domain broader than spectral_domain}

\item{lambda}{numeric. spectral bands corresponding to reflectance and transmittance measurements}

\item{BiochTruth}{numeric. value of biophysical/biochemical parameter to estimate for each sample}

\item{Target}{character. name of the parameter.
Should be picked between "CHL", "CAR", "ANT", "BROWN", "EWT", "PROT", "CBC", "N"}

\item{Parms2Estimate}{character vector. Parameters to estimate (can be 'ALL')}

\item{Initial_Features}{Initial feature set (in nm)}

\item{InitValues}{data.frame. Default values of PROSPECT parameters. During optimization,
they are used either as initialization values for parameters to estimate,
or as fix values for other parameters.
Parameters not compatible with PROSPECT_version are not taken into account.}

\item{PROSPECT_version}{character. Version of prospect model used for the inversion: 'D' or 'PRO'}

\item{MeritFunction}{character. name of the function to be used as merit function
with given criterion to minimize (default = RMSE)}

\item{Est_Brown_Pigments}{boolean. should brown pigments be accounted for during inversion?}

\item{Est_alpha}{boolean. should alpha be accounted for during inversion?}

\item{xlub}{data.frame. Boundaries of the parameters to estimate.
The data.frame must have columns corresponding to \code{Parms2Estimate} first line being
the lower boundaries and second line the upper boundaries.}

\item{verbose}{boolean. set to TRUE to display sample number to be inverted}
