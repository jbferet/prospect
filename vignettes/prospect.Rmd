# Brief introduction & useful links to go further

This tutorial summarizes the different functionalities of the R package `prospect` based on the eponym leaf physical model. 

This tutorial does not aim at detailling the principles of PROSPECT or comparing it to other models, as: 

* The comprehensive description of the model and the physical principes it relies on can be found in the original paper from [Jacquemoud & Baret (1990)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/003442579090100Z "Jacquemoud & Baret, RSE 1990")
* [this website](http://photobiology.info/Jacq_Ustin.html) and [this one](http://teledetection.ipgp.jussieu.fr/opticleaf/models.htm) provide a lot of information on this topic
* [this website](http://opticleaf.ipgp.fr/) gathers references and important links for anyone interested in leaf optical properties and physical modeling

PROSPECT aims at simulating leaf optical properties __(directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance)__ in the optical domain from 400 nm to 2500 nm based on their biophysical properties, including a limited number of biochemical constituents and a unique structure parameter, `N`. PROSPECT is based on a simple representation derived from the __extended plate model__ ([Allen et al., 1970](https://www.osapublishing.org/josa/abstract.cfm?uri=josa-60-4-542)).

Note that the `alpha` parameter is also available as input, and corresponds to the maximum incidence angle relative to the normal defining the solid angle of incident light at the surface of leaf (aims at including surface roughness, default value = 40 degrees).

Many simplications can be identified, and alternative versions of the model have been developed through the years in order to increase the realism of the model. Among the many simplifications:

* The refractive index identifcal for all leaves. It should theoretically change with leaf properties

* The leaf anatomy is not differentiated between an adaxial and an abaxial face

* the leaf surface, which is defined my many properties in real life (presence of waxes, hairs, ...) is identical among leaves in PROSPECT

* ...

The current version of the model implemented in `prospect` is __PROSPECT-PRO__, which includes the following biochemical constituents (defined as _C<sub>i</sub>_ in Fig. 1):

* Chlorophyll a + b `CHL`
* Carotenoids `CAR`
* Anthocyanins `ANT`
* Prown pigments `BROWN`
* Equivalent water thickness `EWT`
* proteins `PROT`
* carbon-based consituents `CBC` (constituents of dry matter other than proteins)

If you want to use __PROSPECT-D__ instead of __PROSPECT-PRO__, please define a value for `LMA` (Leaf mass per area) and set `PROT` and `CBC` to 0, or leave no value (default value = 0) 



The specific absoprtion coefficients corresponding to these constituents are recorded in the variable `SpecPROSPECT` available when loading the package `prospect`.

# `prospect`: forward and inverse mode

In the forward mode, PROSPECT simulates leaf optical propertes based on a set of input parameters corresponding to the biochemical constituents and the N structure parameter.

The performances of PROSPECT for the simulation of teh leaf optical properties are based on the proper calibration of the optical constants, more particularly the specific absorption coefficients corresponding to each biochemical constituent. 

In the inverse mode, an algorithm is used to derive the input parameters from the leaf optical properties.

See the following pages of the tutorial for an illustration of how to use `prospect` in forward and inverse mode.
